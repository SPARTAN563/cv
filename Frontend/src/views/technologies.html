                    Over the past 10 years I've worked with a wide range of different technologies.
                    Some of them I've used because I enjoy working with them, others because I've needed
                    to. Regardless of the reason, I've always learnt something interesting and in most cases
                    it's made me more proficient with other related tools.
                </p>

                    The following are a couple of the technologies which have been particularly memorable
                    as well as a rough estimate of how much I enjoyed working with them as well as my confidence
                    level when working with them (otherwise known as my StackOverflow Index).
