                            I'm a qualified Electrical and Electronic engineer, holding an honours degree
                            from the University of Stellenbosch, a university with a world-renowned engineering
                            faculty. I opted to study engineering instead of computer science partly due to
                            the amount of development experience I already possessed when I applied, but
                            also due to the overwhelming opinion that engineering offered more in the way
                            of practical knowledge, irrespective of your field.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            While studying, I spent a large amount of my available time doing additional work
                            on various software projects, both personal and open source. This included work
                            on a Lua compiler on top of the Microsoft Dynamic Language Runtime, which also
                            resulted in me contributing code to the DLR itself.

                        <p>
                            For my honours project I developed a hardware USB Human Interface Device emulator
                            using a combination of the Raspberry Pi and an Arduino derivative. This was used
                            to enable cross-platform speech recognition using the PocketSphinx speech recognition
                            engine - but also presented a number of other interesting use cases.

                        <p>
                            One of the coolest demos I put together involved opening up Notepad on the target
                            machine and then typing the current time, replacing it once a second. All this
                            could be achieved using only a handful of lines of Node.js code - all thanks to
                            a very straightforward API I developed.

                        <h5 class="center">My thoughts on Engineering</h5>
                        <p>
                            In hindsight, I strongly feel that studying engineering was one of the best decisions
                            I could have made. It exposed me to a range of varied, technically challenging,
                            topics and required me to learn many skills which have served me well.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            One of the most useful skills it forced me to develop was the ability to learn something new
                            in a very short period of time. This has led to me being very comfortable adopting
                            new technologies, languages and frameworks - as the impact on my productivity after
                            the first couple of days is often minimal.
