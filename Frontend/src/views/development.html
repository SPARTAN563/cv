                            I started programming over 10 years ago while at school. I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed it
                            at the time, it completely flummoxed me and was the bane of my existence for many a month.
                            That being said, I was a particularly stubborn child and damned if I was going to let one
                            subject be my downfall...

                            A year later and I was in love, the ability to dive in and find a solution to almost any problem
                            had me hooked. In fact, I soon found myself opening up Visual Studio before I'd even checked
                            for existing solutions online. This, while in hindsight not the most efficient approach, ended up
                            being an exceptional way to jumpstart my descent into software development.

                            By the time I had left school, I was already working, putting together applications and websites
                            for everyone from family and friends to people I met doing holiday work. That meant maintaining my
                            code long after I'd delivered the resulting product and forced me to adopt a number of approaches to assist
                            me. Much of them were picked up as a result of reading code from the many open source projects I
                            contributed to, while others were sourced from the blog posts of Scott Guthrie and Scott Hanselman.

                            Following my secondary schooling, and realizing that at 16 I was far too young to really fit in at
                            university, I decided to take a gap year during which I worked several months as an IT technician,
                            spent a further 3 months working on a game farm and finally worked as a software developer in Perth
                            for another month.

                            During my time at university, studying Electrical Engineering, I spent an exorbitant amount of time
                            working on a combination of personal and open source projects. Late in 2011 I was awarded a membership
                            to Nokia's Developer Program as a result of work I had done on their Maemo platform, while I also
                            began developing systems to assist my residence in various aspects of managing its residents (we were
                            the largest residence on campus, at 500 students).

                            As part of our final year syllabus, we took an entrepreneurship module in which we were required to
                            brainstorm the idea for a product and then develop a business plan built around it. I had spent the
                            past year working on <a route-href="route: project; params.bind: { id: 'frontier' }">Frontier</a>
                            and suggested that our group design a business plan around that. This went exceptionally well, with
                            all of us receiving brilliant marks for the module. Our final presentation was to a number of
                            South African venture capitalists and business owners, a rather daunting prospect. Fortunately,
                            the response to our product and business plan was overwhelmingly positive and at the end of the
                            presentation a number of them offered me jobs at their companies.
